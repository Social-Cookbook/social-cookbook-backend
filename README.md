## Setting up the repository

After cloning the repository,
1.  Go into the repository from the terminal, and run `npm install`. This will install all the required dependencies.
2.  Now, you will need to add your IP address using MongoDB Atlas. Go to `https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database` and log in using the credentials. Then, you should see an alert at the top prompting you to 'Add IP Address'. Click it.
3.  Go back to your terminal and run `npm start` to start the server. If it started successfully, you should see this message on the terminal: 'listening on port 3000'.
4.  If you make any changes, you will need to restart the server each time. If you want to avoid that, instead of `npm start`, you can run `npm run dev`. After that, every time you save your code, the server will update on its own.
